        <h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
        <p>Vindinium is a turn based strategy game where you have to collect the most gold 
        in order to win. The difference between this game and other games is that you have 
        to program artificial intelligence in order to win. </p>
        <h2>Code behind Vindinium</h2>
        <p>There were many parts to my code to get the Vindinium bot to function properly. 
        Here is some of the code showing what my bot does when it is at low health .</p>
        <pre><code>
        if(bot.yourBot.life < 50){
            task = "tavern";
        } else {
            task = "freemines";    
        }
        
            </pre></code>
        <p>What this code is suppose to do is to tell the bot what to do when they are at 
        low health which is to go to a Tavern. The Taverns in Vindinium is suppose to heal 
        your bot which is why I set the bot to where when you have below 50 health, you 
        instantly go to a tavern. There is another part of this code which is the else function.
        The else function allows bots if they don't do the "if" function to do the task "freemines" 
        which allows the bot to takeover mines that enemy bots have not taken yet. This is part of 
        code that tells the bot what to do. Here is another piece of code telling the bot where to go
        when the bot is assigned a task.</p>
        <pre><code>
        if(task === "tavern"){
            var closestTavern = bot.taverns[0];
            for(i = 0; i < bot.taverns.length; i++) {
                if(bot.findDistance(myPos, closestTavern) > bot.findDistance(myPos, bot.taverns[i])) {
                    closestTavern = bot.taverns[i];
                }
            }
            console.log("Something about a Tavern.");
            myDir = bot.findPath(myPos, closestTavern);
        }</pre></code>
        <p>This piece of code is suppose to tell the bot what to do when the task is "tavern." 
        As you can see, there are two "if" functions. The first one is just suppose to tell the 
        bot what to do when the task is "tavern." The second one is suppose to tell the bot which 
        tavern to go to which in this case is the "closestTavern" which is the tavern closest to 
        your bot.</p>
        <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
        <p>I learned how to code AI for specifically Vindinium because I don't know if 
        this type of code will apply to other games other than vindinium.</p>
